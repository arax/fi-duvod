# Task 1 - Solver measurement protocol

## Measurements
* Generate `solver-perf` container image from `Dockerfile`
```bash
docker build -t %YOUR-DOCKERHUB-ID%/solver-perf .
```
* Run
```bash
docker run --rm %YOUR-DOCKERHUB-ID%/solver-perf
```
* Results will be outputted on STDOUT in the following plain text format:
```bash
DATA_FILE_1: \t  VALUE \t VALUE \t VALUE \t VALUE #...
DATA_FILE_2: \t  VALUE \t VALUE \t VALUE \t VALUE #...
#...
```
Each value in this tab-separated matrix represents a specific solver run time for the given input file, in milliseconds.

## Protocol
In `docs`, formatted as a LaTeX source document.

The following scripts expect existing measurement results (from the section above)
in `docs/data/solver-perf.results`.

Histograms in `docs/images` can be re-generated automatically by running
```bash
cd docs
./generate_histograms.rb
```

Results stored in `docs/data` can be partially regenerated by running
```bash
cd docs
./generate_table.rb plain > data/solver-perf-processed.results
```

Formatting for R or LaTeX can be obtained by running
```bash
cd docs
./generate_table.rb latex
./generate_table.rb r
```

The final overlay plot in `docs/images/solver-perf-model.png` can be created by running
```bash
cd docs
gnuplot data/gnuplot_model.gnu
```
